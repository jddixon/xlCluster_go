    * misc_test should revert to being just a library of test 
        functions, with no Test routine in it
        - call this lib_test.go

    * helloGoodbyte_test.go needs to be completed !
        - replace xlReg ephemeral server with simple server running
            the local protocol
    * inQ_test.go needs to be completed
    * keepAlive_test.go needs to be written -- it's currently just a
        stub -- but without any dependency on xlReg

    * revise to either force encryption of all communications (using
        aes_cnx helloAndREply and the AesSession) 
    * or make this optional

    * Bootstrap.Run() morphs into HelloToPeers

2014-09-16
    * pktLayer.HelloToPeers() handled like JoinCluster
    * pktLayer.KeepAlives() 
    * pktLayer.Switch()
    * pktLayer.SendByes()

2014-09-15
    * helloGoodbye_test.go spins up K nodes; each says hello to its
        K-1 peers, pause, then send Bye to peers and shuts down
        - all functionality in misc_test.go, called using one-liners
    * when helloGoodbye_test.go runs OK, modify keepAlive_test.go
        to use the same approach; so it just adds another one-liner

2014-09-12
    * revise keep_alive_test to follow xlReg_go/eph_server_test.go
        as model
        - this means scrapping or revising functions in misc_test.go

2014-09-11
    * Fix references to hash in p_test.go, which should actually refer  *
        to the SHA1-based digital signature
    * Fix the test itself, which should fail because it's a hash rather
        than the expected digSig

2014-09-09
    * Link to online documenation in README.md must *NOT* appear in
        ghpDoc/index.md

    * Need to specify a protocol for commands sent to the server;
        the protocol in p.proto is suitable only for communications
        between the servers in a cluster.

    * Need a test which spawns a cluster of N servers, runs say K
        keep-alives, then shuts down with Bye/Ack.  The low-level
        code must make available the attributes of cluster members
        (ID, listening address (ipv4+port), sigPubKey, commsPubKey,
        isLive, a boolean.  We also expose quorate, a boolean which
        is true if a majority of cluster members are live.

2014-09-07
    * edit gocheck_test.go, recently stolen from xlReg_u, to a form
        more appropriate for testing paxos_go

    * review makeACluster -- it would seem to generate nodes where
        we have no knowledge of their private keys, and so which are
        of limited value
