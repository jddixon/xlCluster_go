    * FIX: Cluster.Strings() loops len(tc.clMembers) times, but 
        doesn't verify that this is the same as curSize
    * rename TestCluster Cluster                                        * DONE
    * differentiate curSize and maxSize of cluster                      * DONE

2014-11-17
    * Flesh out README.md and ghpDoc/index.md
    * need testCluster_test.go
    * need cluster.go for Cluster
        - and cluster_test.go 
        - possibly LocalHostCluster
        - possibly VMCluster
