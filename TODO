    * FIX: Cluster.Strings() loops len(tc.clMembers) times, but 
        doesn't verify that this is the same as curSize
    * rename TestCluster Cluster                                        * DONE
    * differentiate curSize and maxSize of cluster                      * DONE
    * rename ClusterMember.Size ClusterMember.MaxSize                   * DONE

    * need testCluster_test.go                                          * No...
    * need cluster.go for Cluster                                       * DONE
        - and cluster_test.go 
        - possibly LocalHostCluster                                     * DONE
        - possibly VMCluster
